# Example metadata for a preprocessed surface representing seismic attributes.

# A pre-processed surface is a surface that is originally made as part of the model template.
# Pre-processed data must not be confused with "input".

# Example of pre-processed data can be:
# - Well picks stored in RMS
# - Well paths stored in RMS
# - Seismic cubes cropped and adjusted to fit later output

# In the case of seismic cubes, the originally imported seismic cube is 'input'.
# The cropped version which is stored with the template porject, and brought into the 
# FMU case structure upon initializing a case, is 'preprocessed'.
