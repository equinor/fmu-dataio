**fmu-dataio** is a library for handling data flow in and out of Fast Model
Update workflows.  For export, it automates the adherence to the FMU data
standard âœ… including both file and folder conventions as well as richer
metadata ðŸ”– for use by various data consumers both inside and outside the
FMU context via Sumo.

**fmu-dataio** is designed to be used with the same syntax in all parts of an
FMU workflow, including post- and pre-processing jobs and as part of
[Ert](https://github.com/equinor/ert) `FORWARD_MODEL`, both inside and outside
RMS.

**fmu-dataio** is also showcased in
[Drogon](https://github.com/equinor/fmu-drogon). ðŸ’ª

## Data standard definitions

The metadata standard is defined by [JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org/). Within Equinor,
the schema is available on a Radix-hosted endpoint âš¡
