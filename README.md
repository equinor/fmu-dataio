**fmu-dataio** is a library for handling data flow in and out of Fast Model Update workflows.
For export, it automates the adherence to the FMU data standard âœ… including both file and folder
conventions as well as richer metadata ðŸ”– for use by various data consumers both inside and
outside the FMU context via Sumo.

**fmu-dataio** is designed to be used with the same syntax in all parts of an FMU workflow, 
including post- and pre-processing jobs and as part of ERT `FORWARD_MODEL`, both inside and outside RMS.

ðŸ‘‰ [Detailed documentation for fmu-dataio at Read the Docs.](https://fmu-dataio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ðŸ‘€

**fmu-dataio** is also showcased in Drogon. ðŸ’ª

## Data standard definitions
![Radix](https://api.radix.equinor.com/api/v1/applications/fmu-schemas/environments/dev/buildstatus)

The metadata standard is defined by a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/). Within Equinor,
the schema is available on a Radix-hosted endpoint âš¡
