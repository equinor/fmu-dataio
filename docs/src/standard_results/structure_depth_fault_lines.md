# Structure depth fault lines

This exports the modelled structural depth fault lines from within RMS.
These fault lines are polygons that represent the intersection of a modelled
stratigraphic horizon surface with the modelled fault surfaces.

:::{note} 
It is only possible to export **one single set** of depth fault lines per
model workflow, i.e. one fault line polygon object per stratigraphic horizon.

## Requirements

- RMS
- depth fault line polygons stored in a horizon folder within RMS

The fault line polygons must be located within a horizon folder in RMS and be in domain `depth`.
This export function will automatically export all non-empty polygon objects from the provided folder.


:::{important}
These polygons should be extracted from the final depth horizon model using the `Extract Fault Lines`
job in RMS. This will ensure that all fault polygons are closed and that the fault name is added as an attribute.

## Usage

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: fmu.dataio.export.rms.structure_depth_fault_lines.export_structure_depth_fault_lines
```

## Result

Given a stratigraphic horizon name `TopVolantis` the result file will be
`share/results/polygons/structure_depth_fault_lines/topvolantis.parquet`.

This is a tabular file on `.parquet` format. It contains
the following columns with types validated as indicated.

```{eval-rst}
.. autopydantic_model:: fmu.dataio._models.standard_result.structure_depth_fault_lines.StructureDepthFaultLinesResultRow
   :members:
   :inherited-members: BaseModel
   :model-show-config-summary: False
   :model-show-json: False
   :model-show-validator-members: False
   :model-show-validator-summary: False
   :field-list-validators: False
```
