# Structure time surfaces

This exports the modelled structural time surfaces from within RMS.
These surfaces serve as the input for depth conversion in RMS and form the basis for generating
the structural framework in depth. Typically, they are extracted from a structural model in time domain.

:::{note} 
It is only possible to export **one single set** of time surface predictions per 
model workflow.

## Requirements

- RMS
- time surfaces stored in a horizon folder within RMS

The surfaces must be located within a horizon folder in RMS and be in domain `time`.
This export function will automatically export all non-empty horizons from the provided folder.


## Usage

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: fmu.dataio.export.rms.structure_time_surfaces.export_structure_time_surfaces
```

## Result

The surfaces from the horizon folder will be exported as 'irap_binary'
files to `share/results/maps/structure_time_surface/surfacename.gri`.


## Standard result schema

This standard result is not presented in a tabular format; therefore, no validation
schema exists.
