# Initial fluid contact surfaces 

This exports modelled initial fluid contact surfaces from within RMS.

Each fluid contact surface corresponds to a specific zone or a group of zones 
that share a common fluid contact. These surfaces typically cover the full spatial
extent of the zone, and are not restricted to areas above the contact.

The fluid contact types supported is 
- `fwl` (Free water level)
- `fgl` (Free gas level)
- `goc` (Gas-oil contact)
- `gwc` (Gas-water contact)
- `owc` (Oil-water contact)

## Requirements

- RMS
- fluid contact surfaces stored in the `General 2D data` folder within RMS.
- names of surfaces defined in the `stratigraphy` block

A folder named `fluid_contact_surfaces` must exist in the root of the `General 2D data`
folder in RMS. This folder should contain at least one subfolder with a valid fluid contact
name (e.g., `fwl`, see the list above). The export function will automatically process
and export all surfaces found within these subfolders.

:::{note}
The names of the fluid contact surfaces must be defined in the `stratigraphy` block of the
configuration to enable mapping against masterdata.

## Usage

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: fmu.dataio.export.rms.fluid_contact_surfaces.export_fluid_contact_surfaces
```

## Result

The fluid contact surfaces from the `General 2D data` folder will be exported as
'irap_binary' files to `share/results/maps/fluid_contact_surface/contactname/surfacename.gri`.


## Standard result schema

This standard result is not presented in a tabular format; therefore, no validation
schema exists.
