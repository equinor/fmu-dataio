# Field outline

This exports the modelled field outline from within RMS.
This field outline is a polygon representing the outline of the hydrocarbon-filled
reservoir under initial conditions.

The field outline is typically calculated as the intersection between the modelled
top reservoir surface (in depth) and the fluid contact surface. Some assets may
choose to further refine the outline by limiting it to areas with `net` reservoir
properties. It is up to each asset to decide which definition best suits their field.

The primary use case for the field outline is visualization. Unlike the deterministic
outlines from NPD, it is derived directly from the reservoir model, providing greater
precision, alignment with recent data, and adaptability to the unique structure and
fluid contact of each realization.   

:::{note} 
It is only possible to export **one** field outline object per model workflow.
For exporting outlines specific to different fluid types and zones, the
`fluid_contact_outline` standard result should be used instead.

## Requirements

- RMS
- a field outline polygon stored in the `General 2D data` folder within RMS.

The field outline polygon object must be named `field_outline` and be located
within the root of the `General 2D data` folder in RMS. 

The export function will ensure that the polygon object consists of closed polygons
before proceeding with the export.


## Usage

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: fmu.dataio.export.rms.field_outline.export_field_outline
```

## Result

The result file will be `share/results/polygons/field_outline/field_outline.parquet`.

This is a tabular file on `.parquet` format. It contains
the following columns with types validated as indicated.

```{eval-rst}
.. autopydantic_model:: fmu.dataio._models.standard_result.field_outline.FieldOutlineResultRow
   :members:
   :inherited-members: BaseModel
   :model-show-config-summary: False
   :model-show-json: False
   :model-show-validator-members: False
   :model-show-validator-summary: False
   :field-list-validators: False
```


## Standard result schema

This standard result is made available with a validation schema that can be
used by consumers. A reference to the URL where this schema is located is
present within the `data.standard_result` key in its associated object metadata.
