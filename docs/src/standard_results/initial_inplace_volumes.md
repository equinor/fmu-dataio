## Requirements

- RMS
- RMS volumetrics job stored to report table
- Proper grid erosion

Inplace volumes for grids in RMS should always be computed in a **single** RMS
volumetrics job, and the result should be stored as a report table inside RMS.
The simplified export function will use the RMS API behind the scene to
retrieve this table, and all necessary data needed for `fmu.dataio`.

The performance of the volumetrics jobs in RMS has greatly improved from the
past, now typically representing the fastest method for calculating in-place
volumes. However, it is important to note that generating output maps, such as
Zone maps, during the volumetrics job can significantly decelerate the process.

:::{note}
Some assets are using erosion multipliers as a means to reduce the bulk
and pore volume, instead of performing actual erosion by cell removal in the
grid. This is not supported, and proper grid erosion is required. If the erosion
multiplier is important for flow simulation, the erosion and volumetrics job
should be moved to after the export for flow simulation.

## Usage

```{eval-rst}
.. autofunction:: fmu.dataio.export.rms.inplace_volumes.export_inplace_volumes
```

## Result

The volumetric table from RMS undergoes a couple of transformations to adhere to the
`inplace_volumes` standard format:

1. Water zone bulk and pore volumes are calculated by subtracting oil and gas zone
   volumes from the total volumes. The total volumes are removed, and any negative
   values caused by precision issues in RMS are truncated to zero.
2. The fluid-specific columns are unfied into a single set of volumetric columns,
   with an additional `FLUID` column indicating the fluid type. If the `NET` column
   is absent, it is set equal to the `BULK` column, assuming a net-to-gross ratio of one.

Given a grid model name `Geogrid` the result file will be
`share/results/tables/inplace_volumes/geogrid.parquet`.

This is a tabular file that can be converted to `.csv` or similar. It contains
the following columns with types validated as indicated.

```{eval-rst}
.. autopydantic_model:: fmu.dataio._models.standard_results.inplace_volumes.InplaceVolumesResultRow
   :members:
   :inherited-members: BaseModel
   :model-show-config-summary: False
   :model-show-json: False
   :model-show-validator-members: False
   :model-show-validator-summary: False
   :field-list-validators: False
```

```{note}
The payload may contain other columns than the standard columns listed above.
However, when these columns are present, their type is validated.
