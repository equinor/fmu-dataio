Welcome to FMU-dataio's documentation
=====================================

FMU-dataio is a specialized library for managing data in Fast Model Update (FMU) workflows. It focuses on exporting data while adhering to the FMU standards, which include both file and folder conventions, and rich metadata integration for various data consumers. The library is designed for consistent usage across different stages of FMU workflows, such as pre- and post-processing jobs, and is compatible with Ensemble Reservoir Tool (ERT) FORWARD_MODEL, within and outside RMS.

Developed and maintained by Equinor, FMU-dataio streamlines data handling in subsurface reservoir modeling and is integral to FMU's efficiency and accuracy.
