"""
Requirements:
- Can work with existing data + data formats, at least for set-up
- We want to persist these data somewhere (.fmu most likely, in our own form (mapping))
- Mappings can be located and used by other elements in the metadata (accessing official
  names for exported objects)
- Sumo may need data present in every object to index efficiently


Types:
    Wells (case)
    Stratigraphy (case) -> unofficial -> official

    Collections (realization) (do we have a use case for this?)
    Parent-Child (realization) -> relationship mapping (hierarchical)
    Stratigraphy (instance-of relationship)
    FIPNUM-Regions-Zones (realization)
    Regions-Regions (realization)

Stratigraphic mapping:
    TopVolantis:
      stratigraphic: True
      name: VOLANTIS GP. Top  # this is the official DB name
      # additional names, given for demo purpose:
      alias:
        - TopVOLANTIS
        - TOP_VOLANTIS

Well mapping:
    NO 25/2-25 - SMDA Unique Well Identifier
    NO 25/2-25 A - SMDA Name (wellbore identifier)
    25_2-25A - RMS Name
    25A - Eclipse

Parent-Child mapping:
    geogrid--perm.roff
    geogrid.roff
